# SpringAppV1Template

SpringAppV1Template is a starter template for building Spring-based applications. This template is designed to help developers quickly set up a new Spring project with the most popular and commonly used packages in Spring applications. It provides a solid foundation to start building your application, so you can focus on developing business logic rather than setting up infrastructure.

## Features

- **Spring Boot**: Provides a framework that simplifies the development of new Spring applications.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Eases the implementation of JPA-based repositories, providing a consistent API for accessing data.
- **Spring Web**: Facilitates the development of web applications and RESTful APIs.
- **Spring Security**: Provides authentication and authorization capabilities for securing your application.
- **Spring Validation**: Helps with validating user input and data objects.
- **Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)**: Allows for the modularization of concerns such as transaction management and security.
- **Spring Testing**: Offers support for testing Spring components and applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 17 or higher**: Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
- **Maven**: A build automation tool used for managing project dependencies and building the project.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SpringAppV1Template.git
   cd SpringAppV1Template
   ```

2. **Build the project**:

   Run the following command to build the project and download necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:

   Use the following command to start the application:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   The application will start running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

```

- **controller/**: Contains the REST controllers.
- **model/**: Contains the entity classes and data models.
- **repository/**: Contains the repository interfaces for data access.
- **service/**: Contains the business logic of the application.
- **SpringAppV1TemplateApplication.java**: The main application class that serves as the entry point.
- **application.properties**: Configuration file for the application.

## Configuration

The application uses a `src/main/resources/application.properties` file to configure various properties such as database connection, server port, etc. You can modify this file to suit your environment and application needs.
